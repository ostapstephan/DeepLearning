# Paper we were implementing 
# We looked at Rainbow and wanted to implement some of the 
# Algorithims in it
# We ended up choosing DQN, DDQN, D3QN 
# https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.02298.pdf
# The DQN specifics were taken from the paper that introduced it
# https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf
# The hacky paper we implemented to get the dqn to work for continuous output spaces

# Documentation:
# We chose to implement parts of the Rainbow paper for this midterm
# The benchmark for many reinforcement learning aproaches is the 
# open ai gym. Since Ben Ma was going to be doing the inverted penulum,
# we decided to pick a different problem. We chose QWOP initially 
# thinking that it would provide us with a limited number of state 
# variables and actions. We hoped this would reduce training time as
# compared to something like PAC-MAN. What we failed to realize however
# is that The QWOP we know and the bipedal walker api provided by 
# open ai gym were not the same. While the Real game provides 4 discrete
# inputs which are boolean, the open ai gym provides 4 floats from -1 to 1
# corresponding to the torque delivered by each of the 4 joints. 
# Initially we didn't think much of this but quickly we realized that
# the premise of deep Q learning requires a discrete action space.
# Being that we had spent a lot of time setting up the environment,
# we decided to try a hack that we read about in the third paper 
# mentioned above, where we could discretize the outputs. We had high  
# hopes for this since it would essentially be doing what qwop does, 
# however after 15 hours training on a gtx 980 with an i7 4790k cpu, 
# it managed to sometimes split its legs and not fall over. Reailizing 
# we weren't making progress, we switched environments to Breakout-ram-v0
# where we implemented the DQN, dueling DQN and double DQN with Huber loss.
# Our final model was a combination of the models we had implemented. To see if 
# it would converge, we let it also train on Cartpole, we achieved 
# convergence in less than 20 minutes, so we are hoping to see good 
# results from breakout. According to the internet, similar models have
# taken aproximately 35 hours to train, so we will just have to wait. 

# these guys helped us through DQN
